Once you learn Objective-C in this book, you’ll be ready to dive into Cocoa with a full-blown project or another book such as Learn Cocoa on the Mac or Begin- ning iPhone Development, both by Dave Mark and Jeff LaMarche (Apress 2009).

Cocoa and Objective-C are at the heart of Apple’s Mac OS X operating system. Although Mac OS X is relatively new, Objective-C and Cocoa are much older. Brad Cox invented Objective-C in the early 1980s to meld the popular and portable C language with the elegant Smalltalk language. 

When Apple acquired NeXT in 1996 (or was it the other way around?), NextSTEP was renamed Cocoa and brought to the wider audience of Macintosh programmers.
